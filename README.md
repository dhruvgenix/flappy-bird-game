Flappy Bird was designed as a 2D game with simplicity in mind. Hence the primary objective was to develop a game that was a breeze to use for the end user. The push button acts as an interface between the user and the device which enables the control of the movement of the bird and helps it maneuver and skip the incoming obstacles. The bird continues to gradually descend and reach the bottom of the screen unless an input from the user helps it to fly upwards. In parallel the Obstacles are generated with random varying gaps for the bird to pass through them. The game is especially challenging when the user has take care of not letting the bird escape the screen space as well as dodging as many obstacles as possible in order to beat the high score. However, if the either of the challenges are not tackled, the game finishes and displays the current score.
